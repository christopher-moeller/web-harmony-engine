## How to Set Up a New Jenkins Credential (SSH with Private Key)

### Step 1: Access Jenkins Credentials

1. Log in to your Jenkins instance.
2. On the left-hand side menu, click on **"Manage Jenkins"**.
3. From the list of options, select **"Manage Credentials"**.

### Step 2: Select the Credential Domain

1. In the **"Manage Credentials"** page, choose the appropriate domain where you want to store the credential. If unsure, use **"(global)"** for global credentials.
2. Click on the **"(global)"** link or the specific domain where you want to add the credential.

### Step 3: Add a New Credential

1. On the **"Global credentials"** (or your selected domain) page, click on **"Add Credentials"** on the left-hand side.
2. A form will appear for adding a new credential.

### Step 4: Configure the SSH Credential

1. In the **"Kind"** dropdown menu, select **"SSH Username with private key"**.
2. Fill in the details as follows:
    - **Username**: Enter your GitHub username or the name associated with the SSH key.
    - **Private Key**: Choose **"Enter directly"**.
    - **Key**: Paste your SSH private key into the text area. Ensure the key is in the correct format (starting with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`).
    - **Passphrase**: (Optional) If your SSH key has a passphrase, enter it here. If not, leave this field empty.
3. In the **"ID"** field (optional), type `github-harmony-access`.
4. In the **"Description"** field (optional but recommended), enter a description such as "SSH key for GitHub access for Harmony project".

### Step 5: Save the Credential

1. After filling in all the necessary information, click **"OK"**.
2. You should now see the new credential listed under **"Global credentials"** (or the selected domain) with the ID `github-harmony-access`.
